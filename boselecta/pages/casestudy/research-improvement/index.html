                <h4>Outcome</h4>
                <p>
                    The online claims experience is one of four key flows in Asurion Home+. CX research and prior usability testing highlighted five areas for improvement.<br />
                    Through a UX audit and flow analysis, I identified excessive steps that could be simplified, combined, or systemised—leading to meaningful gains in user experience.<br />
                    Usability testing confirmed faster task completion and revealed missing functionality, which once addressed, contributed to higher user satisfaction with online claims.<br />
                    Post-release, claims-related call and chat volume dropped, and user retention increased.

                <h4>Background</h4>
                <p>Asurion Home+ is a device protection and insurance service with a customer-facing marketing site and a portal app for managing devices and claims. I led design for Sprints 1–3, delivering core product flows under shifting requirements and tight timelines. In Sprint 4, I onboarded two additional designers.<br />
                The project was partially localized from a US-led, web-first design, requiring adaptation for regional needs while building a scalable experience.</p>

                <h4>Requirements</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Improve user entry of device problems on first step.</li>
                    <li>Refine compensation selection and give relevant information for ease of selection.</li>
                    <li>Provide step by step guidance</li>

                <h4>Discovery Phase</h4>
                <p>Careful analysis of the user flow led to key enhancements in how users navigated the claims process. Decision points were simplified by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Converting manual selections into system-driven actions</li>
                    <li>Breaking down complex decisions into shorter, manageable flows</li>
                    <li>- Using visual hierarchy to guide user choices.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These refinements reduced cognitive load and made the experience more intuitive. We also identified and filled functionality gaps—like repair scheduling—to minimize friction after task completion.</p>

                <h4>Design Decisions</h4>
                <p>There was some initial fatigue after the first release of the service and I was aware that design debt had crept into the product with some of that being a result of following a web first design approach.  Using the period of rest I decided to lead my design improvements from a mobile first perspective which with some soft skill negotiating could allow design to lead product improvements from a UX standpoint.</p>

        <div class="container section1 flex">
            <div class="col1 col">
                <h4>Improving Problem Identification </h4>
                <p>Initial input relied on outdated desktop date selectors and free-text problem entry. Failure in system recognition triggered up to three follow-up screens, increasing user  friction and cognitive load.<br />
                My solution was to collapse the multi-step process into a clean, mobile-optimized selection tree while retaining the existing text entry option. By improving input precision, the system could better recognize user issues with fewer prompts, making the flow faster and more intuitive.</br />
                I also proposed voice-to-text input to improve accessibility and ease of use, and modernized the date selector with quick options like “Today” and “Yesterday” for faster interaction.</p>

                <h4>Simplifying Compensation Selection</h4>
                <p>With three compensation options—Repair, Replace, and Reimburse—and separate criteria influencing each, the experience risked overwhelming users and creating complexity as new requirements emerged.<br />
                Since repair was the most efficient and frequently used method, I proposed a system matrix based on device type and issue. This would enable the system to recommend the most suitable option while allowing repair and replacement to operate as independent flows.</p>

                <h4>Stakeholder alignment with Product Upgrade</h4>
                <p>Having previously partnered with senior management to develop upgrade feature concepts aimed at retention, I saw this task as an opportunity to quietly bring those ideas back into play.<br />
                Despite device imagery being out of scope, I felt it was key to making the experience more visually compelling and emotionally engaging—especially in encouraging users to upgrade aging devices. The UI was influenced by Amazon’s “Try Before You Buy,” tailored to our service model.</p>

                <p>Over a few weeks of alignment I refined the ideas with my design manager and defined scope with a Product Manager. Senior management gave backing to pursue the ideas for future sprint release.<br />
                Budget was given to test the new concepts blah blah.</p>
