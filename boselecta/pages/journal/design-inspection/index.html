                <h4>From Design to Development</h4>
                <p>While working on two of Asurion’s main customer-facing products, I led a series of design inspections to improve the handoff between design and development, and to catch issues the QA team often missed during UAT. These inspections involved hands-on checks of the final code, looking for elements that didn’t quite pass the eye test. This attention to detail helped reduce cosmetic bugs, raised the standard of implementation, and fostered mutual respect between design and engineering.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>"Design doesn't stop at handoff; it’s essential to see it through to implementation, ensuring the vision is realized in the final product."</p>
                </blockquote>

                <h4>How I Approached It</h4>
                <p>My main focus was to catch clear issues that could affect how customers perceive the product or disrupt smooth usability. The most common problems were spacing inconsistencies—either pushing elements too far down the page or compressing them across responsive breakpoints, falling short of the intended design.<br />
                Incorrect color usage was another frequent issue, often distorting the visual hierarchy and undermining the user’s first impression.<br />  
                While pixel-perfect design is achievable, it’s more productive to tackle that through shared alignment on design variables and templates with the development team.</p>

                <h4>Bridging the divide between teams</h4>
                <p>There’s often some initial tension when design begins to overlap with development and QA territory. But by going the extra mile—providing detailed Jira tickets, redline corrections, and clearly communicating intent—you earn trust and respect. That foundation opens the door to better collaboration and shows that designers understand and respect the realities of development. This mutual understanding goes a long way, especially when advocating for specific design functionality down the line.</p>

                <h4>More Than Just a Handoff</h4>
                <p>Design shouldn’t stop once the handoff is approved. Staying involved through implementation means continuing to advocate for the end user—while also building stronger relationships and allies across the organization.</p>
