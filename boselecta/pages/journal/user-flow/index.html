            Automated Userflow and Screen Repository for a sprint project

        <p>It's easy to skip mapping user flows, but when teams have a shared visual guide, decisions get sharper, and the product comes together more smoothly.</p>

                <h4>The Challenge</h4>
                <p>When I joined my current company, I quickly recognized the value of the app’s 200+ screen user flow in helping me get up to speed. However, each sprint cycle required me to manually update the flow, which became a time-consuming and repetitive task. Realizing an opportunity to improve this, I applied my systemized approach to automate the process using auto-layout and a screen repository.</p>

                    <p>"Userflows aren't glamorous, but many people rely on a userflow for a variety of tasks. When they work well, it's not seen, but when they fail, it's noticed."</p>
                </blockquote>

                <h4>The Challenge</h4>
                <p><strong>User flows were previously updated manually</strong> by copying sprint handoff screens into a new version of the flow. Sections had to be dragged into place, and flow lines reconnected each time—making it a laborious and time-consuming task.</p>
                <p>This process also exposed a deeper issue: the lack of a single source of truth. Without an original, structured base to work from, tracking new screen versions and ensuring consistency across updates became increasingly difficult. It often led to duplication, version mismatches, and time lost chasing clarity.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col2 col">
                <h4>Refining the Workflow</h4>
                <p>I began by componentizing much of the app’s UI—eliminating duplication and using Figma’s library functionality to maintain consistency across variables, text styles, and UI details. This foundation allowed me to scale up into a screen repository, organizing different app sections as reusable components with built-in version control.</p>

                <p>Building on that, I started automating the user flow with auto layout. I nested screens from the library into device frames, so whenever I updated a screen, the flow would automatically adjust — even if the screen height changed. This setup meant different parts of the flow could evolve on their own without needing to rebuild everything, making updates much more seamless.</p>

                <h4>What This Unlocked</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>User flows became more naturally integrated</strong> into the final stages of design sprints and handoff files, no longer feeling like a last-minute or reluctant task.</li>
                    <li><strong>Alignment with the development cycle</strong> helped reduce friction with the QA team, as complete and up-to-date flows were ready for the UAT phase.</li>
                    <li><strong>For the UX team, the shared screen library became a reliable source of truth</strong>, allowing everyone to pull the latest screens into their projects and significantly reducing inconsistencies during design ideation phases.</li>
                    <li><strong>The screen library also made tracking changes across screens much easier</strong>, offering a quick, visual way to review progress and updates.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>The Invisible Work</h4>
                <p>Some of the most valuable work in design is also the least visible. Maintaining user flows, managing variables, and keeping systems consistent often go unnoticed—especially when their impact stretches quietly across multiple teams.</p>
                <p>Many in the organization rely on these flows for different reasons— Directors and PMs planning strategy, New Joiners learning the system, to QA and development tracking changesBut few see the ongoing effort it takes to keep everything aligned and up to date. By streamlining processes, automating repetitive tasks, and building systems that scale, I’ve helped reduce that hidden load.</p>    
                <p>The result? Less time spent fixing broken pieces, and more time freed for creative thinking and deeper problem-solving. It’s the quiet, foundational work that holds everything together—and makes the visible work shine.</p>
