            Refining Figma design tokens<br class="dt-set" /> for Developer handoff

                <h4>Why this Matters</h4>
                <p>I've worked as both a designer and developer, so I understand how crucial variables are for efficient scalability. But I also know they serve different purposes: designers need clear context and an understanding of what's available, while front-end developers need structured tokens and predictability to avoid second-guessing how to define values in their CSS.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>"Tokens and variables aren't just technical details—they're the foundation of a strong design-dev partnership."</p>

                <h4>Breaking It Down</h4>
                <p>We started by aligning our design system with development practices, choosing rem values to maintain consistency with CSS. While Figma’s limitations presented some challenges, we focused on simplicity. We first defined a set of basic tokens that were easy for developers to follow, then built out more contextual variables for designers. By covering all styling variables, we removed the need for interpretation by both devs and designers, ensuring everything remained small and manageable while offering the right level of detail for visual hierarchy.</p>

            <div class="col2 col">
                <h4>The Result</h4>
                <p>By organizing and structuring these variables, we created a set of CSS root variables that could be applied to a web app with multiple client instances. This gave developers a streamlined, consistent foundation to work from, making implementation smoother. Applying these variables across all screen UIs was a challenging task, but it ultimately eliminated inconsistencies, ensured a cohesive design implementation, and improved collaboration between design and development teams. It also freed the design team to focus more on problem-solving and UX, rather than getting bogged down by visual design details.</p>

            <div class="col2 col">
                <h4>It's in the Details</h4>
                <p>The careful attention to these small details meant our design vision was much more accurately realized in the final product. And perhaps most importantly, developers didn't face unnecessary friction, ensuring a collaborative and efficient process from start to finish.</p>
